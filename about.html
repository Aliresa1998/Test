                The NewcastleGateshead tourism website is brought to you by the marketing team at NewcastleGateshead Initiative (NGI) - a group of people who are all based in the region and passionate about promoting the North East of England as a world-class, vibrant tourism destination.

NewcastleGateshead Initiative works collaboratively to demonstrate Newcastle, Gateshead and the wider North Eastâ€™s rich and varied leisure tourism offer. We take great pride in showcasing the range of excellent attractions, award-winning food and drink establishments, vibrant events and first-class accommodation on offer in Newcastle and Gateshead as well as in Northumberland, North Tyneside and south of the river in South Tyneside, Sunderland and Durham.

NewcastleGateshead Initiative brings unique experiences to local, national and international audiences to ensure the region is a go-to destination for business and leisure visitors and holiday makers, as well being known as a first-class place to live and work. The organisation is closely aligned with the work that VisitBritain and VisitEngland do to promote the UK's world-renowned tourism industry. 

NewcastleGateshead Initiative works with partners Newcastle City Council and Gateshead Council to best showcase the region and to work in partnership with businesses across a range of sectors.

As well as a focus on leisure tourism, NGI also has two other departments - an award-winning Convention Bureau which supports business events in the region and an inward investment team, Invest Newcastle, which helps businesses to locate, expand and flourish here in Newcastle. 

Businesses who wish to find out more information can visit the NewcastleGateshead Initiative Tourism Hub which has details of our latest leisure tourism activities as well as links to business support schemes and marketing resources - to help you develop and promote your tourism business - and a round-up of ways tourism businesses are invited to work with NGI.
